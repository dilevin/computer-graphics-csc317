## Course Overview

This course introduces the basic concepts and algorithms of computer graphics.
It covers the basic methods needed to model and render 3D objects, including
much of the following: graphics displays, basic optics, line drawing, affine and
perspective transformations, windows and viewports, clipping, visibility,
illumination and reflectance models, radiometry, energy transfer models,
parametric representations, curves and surfaces, texture mapping, graphics
hardware, ray tracing, graphics toolkits, animation systems.

**Prerequisites:** C/C++ Programming, Linear Algebra, Calculus, Numerical
Methods.

The student is expected to read background material on the hardware and local
software, and should be comfortable with elementary linear algebra, geometry,
and vector calculus. It is also assumed that the student is comfortable
programming in basic C++.

**_(Strongly)_ Recommended preparation:** Multivariable Calculus

## Recommended Textbook

![The Book.](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~srm/fcg4/K22616_cover-300.jpg)

This class involves  **_required reading_** from:

[_Fundamentals of Computer Graphics, Fourth
Edition_](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~srm/fcg4/), Steve Marschner, Peter Shirley,
et al. 2015.

Digital e-book are available at [CRC
Press](https://www.crcpress.com/Fundamentals-of-Computer-Graphics-Fourth-Edition/Marschner-Shirley/p/book/9781482229394).


## Lecture Schedule

**Note: All assignments except 9 are available immediately. BUT we are only covering one assignment at a time. While  you are welcome to look ahead, future assignments
have not been debugged and we will not answer questions about them at tutorial or office hours until we cover them in lecture**

You can find a series of short videos cut up by lectures and topics voicing over the lecture slides [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cWDOSB-DHepfBlj_vdDsf9mU9sLP8sem?usp=sharing).

## Quizzes
There will be 4 online quizzes available through Quercus. Each quiz will cover the content of two assignments each, from assignment 1 to assignment 8. Each quiz will go live after the respective topics are covered in class and must be completed on Quercus by the end of the term (December 3rd).

## Grading

| % | Item |
| ----: | :-------------- |
|64| Assignments (best 8 of 9)
|12| 4 Quizzes (Online)
|12| In Tutorial Test
|12| In Class Test

There will be nine programming assignments of which we will  count the best 8 marks (8% each).

## Lateness Policy

Every student is given ten (10) late days which are automatically applied,starting at midnight on the due date. Weekends count as late days.  

If you plan on not submitting an assignment (to take advantage of the best 8-of-9 policy) please let us know so late days aren't applied. 

### Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is a very serious matter and can result in very serious
consequences. Note that academic offences may be discovered and handled
retroactively, even after the semester in which the course was taken for credit.
This is a challenging class aimed at teaching you the fundamentals of computer
graphics. You wont learn much if you cheat but you might get a good grade if you
get away with it. If all you want is a good grade take an easier class where you
wont have to cheat!

For purposes of this class, academic dishonesty is defined as:

- Any attempt to pass off work on a test, quiz or assignment that didn't come straight out of your
  own head.
- Any collaboration on written or programming assignments (its ok to share ideas
  on programming assignments but the code MUST be your own) in which the
  collaborating parties don't clearly and prominently explain exactly who did
  what, at turn-in time.
- Any activity that has the effect of significantly impairing the ability of
  another student to learn. Examples here might include destroying the work of
  others, interfering with their access to resources (e.g., digital cameras), or
  deliberately providing them with misleading information.

### Email & Bulletin Board Traffic

- Please use the TA Email List for all communications except for things that require a Professors dedicated attention. 
- Use github issue pages on assignment pages for questions
- Do NOT broadcast pieces of your code or answers to written assignments to the
  github issues. Specific or general implementation questions whose answer
  would benefit all students in the class are appropriate. However: the bulletin
  board is NO replacement for the tutorial hour. That should be the main forum
  for asking/answering questions of this sort.
- Questions of the form "I cannot find the problem with my code; here it is, can
  you help me" are unlikely to be replied, so don't count on it. If you have a
  question with code, take it to the TA office hours or to the tutorials.
